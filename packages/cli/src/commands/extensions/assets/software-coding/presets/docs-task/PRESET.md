description: Create the planning, progress, review, evidence, and closeout package for design, documentation, or chore work that produces no code commit.
whenToUse: Use for pure design, documentation, research, or chore tasks whose deliverable is a document or decision rather than code, so completion is gated on a real closeout and an approved review instead of CI or code-doc reconciliation.

# Documentation / Design Task

A lightweight software-coding preset for work whose deliverable is a design, document, or chore rather than a code change.

It carries the same substantive completion requirements as any task — a real closeout and an approved typed Review — but omits the `ci` and `code-doc-reconciliation` completion gates, which assume a code commit that design and documentation work does not produce.
