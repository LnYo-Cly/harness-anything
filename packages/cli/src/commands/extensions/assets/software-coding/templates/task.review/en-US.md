# Review

Status: not-started

Record the actual review result before closeout; initial not-started with no findings blocks `ha task complete`. Review produces a task verdict (PASS/FAIL), not a decision primitive. If review exposes a load-bearing route choice, then run `ha decision propose ...`.

Per `dec_mrg3z1we/CH4`, Facts are explicit `0..N` promotions of load-bearing observations, not a review quantity gate. Check delivery evidence in Execution outputs; do not copy it into Facts merely to satisfy review.
