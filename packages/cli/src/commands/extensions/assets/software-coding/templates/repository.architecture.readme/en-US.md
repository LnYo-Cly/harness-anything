# Repository Architecture

## Purpose

This folder is the coding vertical's durable navigation surface for understanding the repository before changing it. Keep the model at component or subsystem level; it is not a file inventory.

## Activation

This README does not enable architecture tooling. The feature is configured only when `architecture-manifest.json` exists beside this file. A present manifest must use `"enabled": true`; delete the manifest to disable the feature.

Run architecture initialization explicitly before replacing the placeholders below. Harness does not install LikeC4 or any extractor automatically.

## Source of Truth

- `architecture-manifest.json` owns provider routing, model location, stable view IDs, source scopes, and extractor declarations. `modelRoot` resolves from the manifest directory; `provider.config` and every `views[].path` resolve from `modelRoot`.
- The bundled executable `architecture-model/v1` contract owns the stable metadata keys, lifecycle values, relationship expectations, evidence formats, and required view IDs used by scripts and adapters.
- `model/**/*.c4` owns human-authored architecture intent: semantic nodes, responsibilities, boundaries, and expected relations.
- Generated code snapshots are observations. Store them outside the authored model and never copy them back into the model automatically.

## Update Model

The authored model changes only through an explicit reviewed edit. A snapshot is refreshed only when `architecture-snapshot` runs for its owning task, and comparison happens only when `architecture-check` runs. No background process rewrites either artifact, no import scan promotes itself to architecture intent, and neither command is a universal completion or CI gate.

Physical manifest paths (`modelRoot`, `provider.config`, and `views[].path`) must be NFC-normalized POSIX paths relative to their resolution bases defined above, and they must be portable on Windows. Provider config and view targets are compared after NFC normalization and case folding; a collision is invalid. Source scope globs are repository-root-relative selectors rather than physical paths, so they retain glob metacharacters such as `*` and `?` while still rejecting NUL, absolute paths, traversal, backslashes, and leading `!` negation.

The manifest links a source scope to a semantic node through `sourceScopes[].nodeId`. That value must resolve to exactly one node whose LikeC4 `metadata.archId` is identical. Scope globs match normalized repository-root-relative POSIX paths: includes form a union, excludes always win, and array order has no precedence. Mapping is evaluated separately for each extractor using only its `sourceScopeIds`: zero matches means `unmapped`, while more than one means an ambiguous, invalid mapping.

## Authoring Contract

Use `metadata.archId` as identity; LikeC4 names, fully qualified names, titles, layouts, and source paths may change without changing it. Element `archId` values are globally unique within the model, and relationship `archId` values are globally unique within the model. Starter nodes and relations are marked `draft` placeholders and must be replaced with repository evidence; architecture checks treat remaining placeholders as invalid configuration, not as a fresh model.

Every element records `archId`, `status`, `owner`, `responsibilities`, and `nonResponsibilities`. Every relationship records `archId`, `status`, and an `expectation` of `allowed`, `required`, or `forbidden`. An optional `extractorIds` array references manifest extractor IDs; only a relationship that names an extractor participates in that extractor's drift comparison. Both endpoint `archId` values must be covered by that extractor's referenced scopes, or the configuration is invalid. Relationships without `extractorIds` remain queryable architecture intent and are not guessed to be import edges. A `verified` element or relationship must cite at least one evidence value: `adrRefs` are repository-root-relative POSIX paths, while `decisionRefs` use canonical `decision/<decision-id>` references. Source paths live only in manifest source scopes.

## Views

The V1 contract requires three stable view IDs while keeping model and views in separate files:

- `landscape`: the component-level system map.
- `write-path`: the authored change/write flow.
- `runtime`: the important runtime boundaries.

Agents cite the stable manifest view ID and node `archId`, not a display title.

## Agent Query Routing

At the start of every coding task, check for the manifest before broad source search. When it is enabled, read this entry and load only the view or flow needed to answer the smallest useful set of questions: which stable node owns the behavior, what directly enters and leaves it, which multi-hop paths are affected, and why the selected implementation layer is canonical. This deeper lookup is required for cross-module, unfamiliar-area, write-path, runtime-boundary, dependency-direction, or unclear-owner work. Docs-only or clearly local low-risk work may record N/A with a reason. Record only stable references and the current snapshot digest in the task's `code-impact-analysis.md`.

If source search reveals multiple plausible owners or layers, uncertain incomers/outgoers, or conflicting documentation, return to the map before continuing source search. Recover in this order: stable node → view/flow → source scope → code.

When a LikeC4 MCP server is already available, use `search-element` or `read-element` to resolve the stable node, `read-view` for the declared flow, `query-graph` for direct incomers/outgoers, and the recursive graph or relationship-path tools only when the change crosses boundaries. The official server can be exposed by an active editor extension, `likec4 mcp`, or `@likec4/mcp`; MCP is an optional query accelerator, never a task prerequisite.

The deterministic fallback is always available: read the manifest and `.c4` text in the order above, then run `ha script run vertical:software-coding:architecture-check --task <task-id>`. If the project already provides LikeC4, `likec4 validate` checks model syntax. Do not install or start network tooling merely to complete an ordinary task.

Interpret check states explicitly: `not-configured` means the normal coding workflow continues; `fresh` supplies a snapshot digest to cite; `drifted` must preserve both model intent and conflicting code evidence; `invalid` must expose the configuration issue; `tool-missing` must record the missing tool and continue with text-model navigation where possible. Docs-only or clearly local low-risk work may record N/A with a reason instead of running external queries.

## Validation

Validate the manifest with the bundled `architecture-manifest/v1` contract. If LikeC4 is explicitly available, run `likec4 validate` from the manifest's `modelRoot`. Tool absence is a deterministic degraded state, never a reason to auto-install over the network.

Read in this order: manifest, relevant view, referenced nodes and relations, then their ADR/decision evidence. If a generated snapshot disagrees with the model, report the conflict instead of silently editing either side.

## Migration and Conflicts

Initialization is no-overwrite. Existing architecture files must be reviewed and migrated deliberately; an initializer reports every conflicting path and leaves all existing content unchanged. Commit authored intent, but follow the repository policy for generated or local snapshots.
